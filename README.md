This scatterplot shows my daily activity specifically walking + running distance over several years extracted from the Apple Health app. Hovering over the dots reveals the tooltip which gives the date and distance covered. I customized the color scale to set a gradient with the gold color indicating the highest level of activity and the dark candy apple red color depicting a danger zone of no activity.

## Setup
Run local server with ```python3 -m http.server```
